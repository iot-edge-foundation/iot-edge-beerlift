# iot-edge-beerlift
Beer lift connected to the Azure cloud

*Note*: This is still a work in progress. 

# Materials used

## For the Beer Lift
* thread screw bar (1+ meter)
* Lenze electromotor with gearbox - type SSN31-1UHAR-056C21 (second hand) (340V 3 Phase downscaled to 220V 1 Phase)
* Capacitor 12.0uF (for switching back to 1 phase)
* Two relays, Siemens Sirius 3RT1015-1BB41 (For switching 220V on the motor, one in each direction)
* Two Snap-Action Switches with roller Lever; 3-Pin (for normally closed usage)
* Wires, Wago connectors, etc.

## For the controller
* Raspberry Pi 3
* RPi GPIO extension connector and flat cable
* Two-channel 5V relais module
* DHT22 AM2302 Digital temperature and humidity sensor
* One 10K resistor for the DHT22
* Two MCP23017 - i2c 16 input/output port expanders
* Prototyping PCB boards, wires, etc
